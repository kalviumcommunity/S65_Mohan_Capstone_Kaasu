# Kaasu - AI-Powered Family Financial Advisor & Planner

## Problem Statement  
Managing finances is a challenge for both individuals and families. Many people struggle with tracking expenses, setting budgets, and managing shared family finances. Existing solutions often:  

- Require manual data entry, making them time-consuming and prone to errors.  
- Lack AI-powered insights, preventing users from understanding their spending habits.  
- Do not offer real-time collaboration, making family finance tracking difficult.  
- Pose security risks by requiring direct bank connections.  

### This project aims to solve these problems by:  
- Automating transaction analysis using AI from uploaded PDFs.  
- Providing real-time family finance tracking for multiple users.  
- Offering AI-powered insights to help users budget smarter.  
- Ensuring security by allowing only PDF uploads instead of direct bank linking.
